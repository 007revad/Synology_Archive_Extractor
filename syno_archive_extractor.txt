Steps needed after running syno_archive_extractor:

After running syno_archive_extractor.sh you will have a hda.tgz file that you'll want to extract. 

Do NOT extract it as root or sudo or it will overwrite all of DSM system files!?!?!
 
If you use WinRAR to extract hda.tgz you'll get a file named hda. 
Just rename it to hda.tar then extract hda.tar or use WinRAR to open it and extract just file(s) you want.

Note: When you use WinRAR to extract the hda.tar file it will replace symlinks with the files those symlinks point to.
